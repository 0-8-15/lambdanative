# Introduction

LambdaNative is an open-source (BSD licensed) cross-platform
development environment written in Scheme ([Gambit-C](https://github.com/feeley/gambit)), supporting
Android, iOS, OS X, Linux, Windows and OpenBSD.

LambdaNative is actively developed and used at the
University of British Columbia by the Pediatric Anesthesia
Research Team for production of clinical mHealth
applications, including mission-critical embedded drug
delivery systems and telemonitoring apps for iPhone
and Android smartphones.  LambdaNative-based applications
have been used in clinical trials on >10,000 subjects in
Canada, France, India, Uganda, Bangladesh, and South
Africa, in >10 separate clinical studies:

If you use the LambdaNative framework for your own work, please reference this paper.

A slideshow describing the LambdaNative framework is available [here](https://github.com/part-cw/lambdanative/blob/master/docs/LambdaNative.pdf?raw=true).

`uSquish`, the simple example game included in the LambdaNative repository,
is available as a free download on the Apple and Google stores: [uSquish for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/usquish/id647308142) and [uSquish for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.bccw.usquish)
